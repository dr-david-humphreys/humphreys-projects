# Module Three Mid-Module Project

There are two options for the mid-module project. The two options are:
1. Implement the Solar System Geek E-Commerce Application as described.
   - Open the folder `solar` with VS Code `File/Open Folder...` 
2. Create and implement your own application.
   - Open the folder `custom` with VS Code `File/Open Folder...` 

Note: The provided Solar System Geek E-Commerce Application is guided with clear requirements describing exactly what work needs to be done.
However, since the application and the instructions were created by Tech Elevator it is a part of the
Tech Elevator curriculum. As a result the source code can not be hosted publicly nor used directly in your software portfolio.
