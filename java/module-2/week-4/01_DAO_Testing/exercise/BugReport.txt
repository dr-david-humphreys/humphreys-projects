Bug 1

Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee()
Expected output:
    Expected 2 timesheets for employee_id 1
Actual output:
    1 timesheet for employee_id 1

    Changed the if (results.next()) statement to a while (results.next()) loop

Bug 2

Test that demonstrates problem:
    getTimesheetsByProjectId_with_valid_project_id_returns_list_of_all_timesheets_for_project()
Expected output:
    Expected 3 timesheets for project_id 1
Actual output:
    2 timesheets for project_id 1
How did you fix this bug?
    Where clause was filtering by employee_id instead of project_id, changed employee_id to project_id

Test that demonstrates problem:
    createTimesheet_creates_timesheet()
Expected output:
    A created timesheet
Actual output:
    No new timesheet was created

    No timesheet was being created because there was no code to create a new unique PK timesheet_id
    Added the line "newTimesheet.setTimesheetId(newId);" after the catches to create a new timesheet_id
