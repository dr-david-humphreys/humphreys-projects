8 inch Chef's Knife
Large Cutting Board

Ingredients
Mango Salsa
2 ripe fresh mangoes, peeled & diced
1/2 cup finely diced red onion
1-2 jalapeños, seeds & membrane removed, finely diced*
1/3 cup chopped cilantro leaves & stems
2 limes, juiced
1/2 teaspoon Morton kosher salt

Fish
1.5 pounds cod, cut into 1.5 inch pieces & pat dry*
1 1/2 Tablespoons avocado or vegetable oil
1 Tablespoon honey
1 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper*
1 teaspoon Morton kosher salt*

For Serving
8-10 corn tortillas

Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a medium bowl, toss together the mango, onion, jalapeño, cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, toss together the cod, oil, honey, chili powder, cumin, paprika, onion powder, garlic, cayenne, and salt.
3. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer the fish to the sheet, placing the pieces about 1 inch apart.
4. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Broil for 3-5 minutes or until slightly blackened, watching closely so they do not burn. Assemble tacos.

Notes
Jalapeño: You can leave the seeds and membranes on for extra spice. For less spice, use only one pepper.
Kosher Salt: All of my recipes are tested with Morton kosher salt unless noted otherwise. It is the best salt for everyday cooking because of its size and flavor. If using table salt, the amount should be reduced. I highly recommend picking up some kosher next time you are at the store!
Cod: I prefer to use cod for these tacos because it is thicker and firm, but still super tender and flakey. I buy wild caught frozen filets, thaw them overnight in the fridge, and then dice them into large chunks. You do not have to dice the fish, but I prefer bite size pieces for tacos. You can also use pollock or even salmon. I do not recommend tilapia because it is too thin.
Cayenne Pepper: If you are sensitive to spice, omit. Use ½ teaspoon if you want these to be hot, and only ¼ teaspoon for a mild to medium heat.
Pat the fish dry. If there is too much water on the fish it will steam in the oven and not develop much color. Use multiple paper towels to absorb as much excess moisture as possible before seasoning.
Broil the fish. This is going to slightly char the exterior and add tons of flavor.
Heat the tortillas. I love to warm my tortillas over the gas flame on my stove. You can also use the microwave or a pan on the stove.
Grill or pan fry. If you do not want to bake the fish, do not cut it into chunks. Pan fry or grill the filets over medium high heat until cooked through.
